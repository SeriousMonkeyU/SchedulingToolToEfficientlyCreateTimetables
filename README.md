# SchedulingToolToEfficientlyCreateTimetables
SEP1 project

The purpose of the project is to create an efficient automatic-working solution to relieve
Bob of his manual work as much as possible. The interview with Bob was the first
stepping-stone into creating requirements for this project. The requirements were later
split into critical, high, and low priorities, functional and non-functional. This created a
baseline for the analysis phase that builds more upon the requirements.
In the analysis, multiple diagrams are drawn to create an outline and a more accurate
expectation of the solution. First, a use case diagram is made to see how many actors
will be present in the solution, and what are their actions within the solution. The result
laid an analytical foundation that will be used to create activity diagrams for each action
and general use case description for a detailed view. Lastly, activity diagrams are
produced, that show the flow of actions and the possible exception sequences for each
functionality. At the start of design phase, a class diagram and sequence diagram are
created. These diagrams are used as a basis for making the GUI and website designs.
In the implementation, there are multiple methods chosen for a granular overview. These
methods were chosen both from the system and website implementation. Additionally,
few the most vital and complex methods are analyzed in terms of time complexity.
Scheduling system is made in Java, while the view to the schedule is made in a website
format using JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap 5, HTML and CSS. The testing was done in
a simple manner, where the functionality was being tested with a passed/failed scenario.
As a conclusion, the project was produced before the given deadline while fulfilling the
requirements and obtaining the expected goals. 

This is the copy of the work done by a group of 4 people during 1st semester of Software Engineering study.
