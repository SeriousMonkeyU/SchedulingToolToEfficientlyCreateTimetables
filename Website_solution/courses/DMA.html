                            The aim of the course is to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of
                            algorithmic thinking, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to
                            real-world
                            computational problems by building on the principles of mathematics.
                            The course will enable the student to apply a wide range of existing algorithms and data
                            structures for fundamental problems, as well as general methods for developing new
                            algorithms
                            and mathematical tools for analyzing the correctness and efficiency of algorithms.
                            This is of paramount importance for the ability to develop efficient software, and is
                            central to
                            the understanding of upper and lower bounds for computational problems.

                            exam:
                            <ol>
                                <li>The student must have an attendance of at least 75%.</li>

                            The test is completed in the Flow-lock browser in Wiseflow.
                            The final grade will reflect an over-all assessment of the mandatory assignments and the
                            written
                            test.
                            The final test must, however, be awarded a passing grade in order for the final grade to
                            be a
                            passing grade.

                            The students are allowed to use any notes, books, and/or other written/printed
                            material.
                            Any type of communication between students or between a student and an external party is
